# Practice Control flow

Five more challenges on "Control Flow" in Ruby programming language, each focusing on a different flow operation:

### 1. Challenge for `if`, `else`, `elsif`:

**Problem:**
Create a program that takes a user's score as input (0 to 100) and prints their grade according to the following rules:
- If the score is between 90 and 100 (inclusive), print "A."
- If the score is between 80 and 89, print "B."
- If the score is between 70 and 79, print "C."
- If the score is between 60 and 69, print "D."
- If the score is below 60, print "F."

**Example:**
```ruby
# User inputs 78
# Output: C
```

### 2. Challenge for Ternary Operator (`? :`):

**Problem:**
Write a program that prompts the user to enter three numbers. Use the ternary operator to find and print the maximum of these three numbers.

**Example:**
```ruby
# User inputs: 7, 12, 5
# Output: Maximum is 12
```

### 3. Challenge for `case` Statement:

**Problem:**
Create a program that asks the user to enter a day of the week. Use a `case` statement to determine if it's a weekday or weekend. Print "Weekday" or "Weekend" accordingly.

**Example:**
```ruby
# User inputs: Monday
# Output: Weekday
```

### 4. Challenge for `unless` Statement:

**Problem:**
Write a program that prompts the user to enter their age. Use the `unless` statement to check if the age is less than 21. If so, print "You are not allowed to drink."

**Example:**
```ruby
# User inputs 19
# Output: You are not allowed to drink
```

### 5. Challenge for Logical Operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`):

**Problem:**
Implement a program that checks if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, divisible by either 3 or 5 (but not both), or not divisible by either. Take the number as user input and print the result.

**Example:**
```ruby
# User inputs 15
# Output: Divisible by both 3 and 5
```

These challenges cover a range of control flow operations in Ruby, providing opportunities to practice and reinforce your understanding of different flow control mechanisms.
