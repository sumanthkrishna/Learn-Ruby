# Practice Methods

Below are 10 different exercises to practice methods in Ruby programming. Each exercise is designed to reinforce different aspects of method usage, parameters, and return values:

### 1. **Simple Greeting Method:**
Create a method called `greet` that takes a name as a parameter and prints a greeting message. Call the method with different names.

### 2. **Calculator Method:**
Write a method called `calculate` that takes two numbers and an operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) as parameters. Implement the method to perform the specified operation and return the result.

### 3. **Array Sum Method:**
Define a method called `sum_array` that takes an array of numbers as a parameter and returns the sum of all elements in the array.

### 4. **Reverse String Method:**
Create a method called `reverse_string` that takes a string as a parameter and returns the reversed version of the string.

### 5. **Factorial Method:**
Write a method called `factorial` that takes a number as a parameter and returns its factorial (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1).

### 6. **Unique Elements Method:**
Implement a method called `unique_elements` that takes an array as a parameter and returns a new array with only the unique elements.

### 7. **Temperature Converter Method:**
Create a method called `convert_to_celsius` that takes a temperature in Fahrenheit as a parameter and returns the equivalent temperature in Celsius.

### 8. **Palindrome Check Method:**
Write a method called `is_palindrome` that takes a string as a parameter and returns true if the string is a palindrome and false otherwise.

### 9. **Prime Number Method:**
Define a method called `is_prime` that takes a number as a parameter and returns true if the number is prime and false otherwise.

### 10. **Fibonacci Series Method:**
Implement a method called `fibonacci` that takes a number as a parameter and returns an array containing the Fibonacci series up to that number.

These exercises cover a variety of scenarios involving method creation, parameter usage, and return values. Practice these exercises to strengthen your understanding of methods in Ruby.
