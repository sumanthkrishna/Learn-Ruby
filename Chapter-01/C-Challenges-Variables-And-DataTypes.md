# Practice Variables and Data Types

Here are ten exercises or challenges to practice and reinforce your understanding of variables and data types in the Ruby programming language:

1. **Variable Swapping:**
   Swap the values of two variables without using a temporary variable. For example, if `a = 5` and `b = 10`, after the operation, `a` should be `10` and `b` should be `5`.

2. **Temperature Conversion:**
   Write a program that converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius. Prompt the user to enter a temperature in Fahrenheit, perform the conversion, and output the result.

3. **String Manipulation:**
   Take a user input string and perform the following operations:
   - Print the length of the string.
   - Convert the string to uppercase.
   - Check if the string contains the word "Ruby."

4. **Array Operations:**
   Create an array of numbers and perform the following operations:
   - Print the sum of all elements.
   - Print the largest and smallest elements.
   - Append a new element to the array.

5. **Hash Manipulation:**
   Create a hash representing a person with keys for "name," "age," and "city." Perform the following operations:
   - Print the person's name.
   - Add a new key-value pair for "occupation."
   - Print all keys in the hash.

6. **Boolean Operations:**
   Write a program that checks if a given number is even or odd. Take user input for the number and output whether it's even or odd.

7. **Symbol Exploration:**
   Create symbols for different colors (e.g., :red, :green, :blue). Perform operations such as checking if a particular symbol is present in an array of symbols.

8. **Concatenate Strings:**
   Write a program that takes user input for first and last names and outputs a greeting message using string concatenation.

9. **Working with Nil:**
   Create a variable and intentionally set it to `nil`. Check if the variable is `nil` and handle it accordingly.

10. **Dynamic Typing Challenge:**
    Create a program that takes user input and prints the data type of the entered value. Handle different types such as strings, integers, and floats.

These exercises cover a range of scenarios involving variables and data types in Ruby. They will help you solidify your understanding and provide practical experience with these concepts.
