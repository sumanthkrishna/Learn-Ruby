# Practice Control flow

Below are five challenges on "Control Flow" in Ruby programming language, each focusing on a different flow operation:

### 1. Challenge for `if`, `else`, `elsif`:

**Problem:**
Create a program that takes a user's age as input. Using `if`, `else`, and `elsif`, classify the age into the following categories:
- If age is less than 18, print "Minor."
- If age is between 18 and 65 (inclusive), print "Adult."
- If age is greater than 65, print "Senior Citizen."

**Example:**
```ruby
# User inputs 22
# Output: Adult
```

### 2. Challenge for Ternary Operator (`? :`):

**Problem:**
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number. Use the ternary operator to determine if the number is even or odd. Print "Even" or "Odd" accordingly.

**Example:**
```ruby
# User inputs 7
# Output: Odd
```

### 3. Challenge for `case` Statement:

**Problem:**
Implement a simple calculator program that takes two numbers and an operator as input (add, subtract, multiply, divide). Use the `case` statement to perform the corresponding operation and print the result.

**Example:**
```ruby
# User inputs: 5, 3, add
# Output: 8
```

### 4. Challenge for `unless` Statement:

**Problem:**
Create a program that checks if a given number is negative using the `unless` statement. If the number is negative, print "Negative," otherwise, print "Non-negative."

**Example:**
```ruby
# User inputs -3
# Output: Negative
```

### 5. Challenge for Logical Operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`):

**Problem:**
Write a program that simulates a login system. Prompt the user to enter a username and password. Use logical operators to check if both the username and password are correct. If correct, print "Login successful," otherwise, print "Login failed."

**Example:**
```ruby
# User inputs: username - admin, password - secret
# Output: Login successful
```

These challenges cover different aspects of control flow in Ruby, allowing you to practice various flow operations in different scenarios.
