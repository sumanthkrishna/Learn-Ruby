# Practice Collections

Here are ten Ruby programming challenges or exercises focused on practicing with collections:

### 1. **Array Sum:**
**Problem:**
Write a program that takes an array of numbers as input and calculates their sum.

**Example:**
```ruby
# Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Output: 15
```

### 2. **Unique Elements:**
**Problem:**
Create a function that takes an array as input and returns a new array with only the unique elements.

**Example:**
```ruby
# Input: [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 1]
# Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### 3. **Hash Manipulation:**
**Problem:**
Write a program that creates a hash representing a person. Allow the user to add and remove information (key-value pairs).

**Example:**
```ruby
# User adds: "occupation" => "Engineer"
# User removes: "age"
```

### 4. **String to Array:**
**Problem:**
Write a function that takes a sentence as input and returns an array of words.

**Example:**
```ruby
# Input: "Hello, Ruby programming!"
# Output: ["Hello", "Ruby", "programming"]
```

### 5. **Find Duplicates:**
**Problem:**
Create a function that takes an array and returns a new array containing only the duplicate elements.

**Example:**
```ruby
# Input: [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 1]
# Output: [1, 2]
```

### 6. **Set Operations:**
**Problem:**
Implement a program that takes two sets as input and performs union, intersection, and difference operations.

**Example:**
```ruby
# Input: Set1 = {1, 2, 3}, Set2 = {3, 4, 5}
# Output: Union = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, Intersection = {3}, Difference = {1, 2}
```

### 7. **Reverse String Array:**
**Problem:**
Write a program that takes an array of strings as input and returns a new array with the strings reversed.

**Example:**
```ruby
# Input: ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
# Output: ["elppa", "ananab", "egnaro"]
```

### 8. **Range to Array:**
**Problem:**
Write a function that takes a range as input and returns an array of all the numbers in that range.

**Example:**
```ruby
# Input: 1..5
# Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### 9. **Hash Values Sum:**
**Problem:**
Create a program that takes a hash of numbers as input and calculates their sum.

**Example:**
```ruby
# Input: { "a" => 2, "b" => 5, "c" => 8 }
# Output: 15
```

### 10. **Array Intersection:**
**Problem:**
Write a function that takes two arrays as input and returns a new array containing only the common elements.

**Example:**
```ruby
# Input: [1, 2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5, 6]
# Output: [3, 4]
```

These challenges cover a variety of scenarios involving arrays, hashes, sets, and ranges, providing opportunities to practice and reinforce your understanding of collections in Ruby.
