# Object Oriented Programming :: Practice

Here are five challenges related to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Ruby, along with their solutions:

### Challenge 1: Create a Class Hierarchy for Shapes

**Challenge:**
Create a class hierarchy for different shapes (circle, square, rectangle) with a common base class `Shape`. Implement methods to calculate the area for each shape.



### Challenge 2: Implement a Library System

**Challenge:**
Create a class hierarchy for a library system with classes such as `Library`, `Book`, and `Member`. Implement methods for checking out and returning books.



### Challenge 3: Create a Banking System

**Challenge:**
Design a banking system with classes like `Account`, `Transaction`, and `Customer`. Implement methods for deposit, withdrawal, and transaction history.



### Challenge 4: Modeling a School System

**Challenge:**
Create classes for a school system with `Student`, `Teacher`, and `Course`. Implement methods for enrolling students, assigning teachers, and displaying course information.



### Challenge 5: Implement a Movie Rental System

**Challenge:**
Create classes for a movie rental system with `Movie`, `Customer`, and `Rental`. Implement methods for renting and returning movies, and display customer rental history.



These challenges cover various aspects of Object-Oriented Programming in Ruby, including class hierarchy, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and modeling real-world scenarios.
